# MachineLearningUsingPython
This is repository to learn Machine learning by implementing and training models based on some small datasets and hence improve my skills.
1. Train a classifier on classification of males and females
From a given sample data I have made classification for male or female based on 3 parameters. I have not tampered with data, or applied statistics. I have trained 3 classifier include 1 DecisionTreeClassifier provided by default. I have used 1.LinearSVC 2. KNeighborsClassifier and 3. QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis classifiers for doing the classification of data.

2. Twitter sentiment analysis based on the text of their tweets.
Analyse the sentiment based on the tweets and analysing the text in them using TextBlob library.
