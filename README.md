# MachineLearningUsingPython
This is repository to learn Machine learning by implementing and training models based on some small datasets and hence improve my skills.
1. Train a classifier on classification of males and females
From a given sample data I have made classification for male or female based on 3 parameters. I have not tampered with data, or applied statistics. I have trained 3 classifier include 1 DecisionTreeClassifier provided by default. I have used 1.LinearSVC 2. KNeighborsClassifier and 3. QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis classifiers for doing the classification of data.

2. Twitter sentiment analysis based on the text of their tweets.
Analyse the sentiment based on the tweets and analysing the text in them using TextBlob library.
It gives tags using textblob and then analyse the sentiment in the statement given. I have stored the sentiment values in a csv file. 

3. Movie recommandation system 
In this we have used lightfm library and using a Lightfm model I have trained the data of the recommandation system.
We have given input of some userids and they have returned the movies they have liked in the past and based on dataset we have predicted movies they can watch in the future.
The challenge is to make more recommandation systems.
